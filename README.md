# Unit-One-Challenge
Mini challenge for the first module for coding boodcamp. 

For the first week of the UNC Web Dev bootcamp, this challenge focuses on HTML accessibility, organization, and readabilty.
The source code for this mock professional website has been adjusted to fit the aformentioned values. There were several formatting
issues such as incorrect heading order, lack of semantic elements, and accessbility shortcomings (such as no alt="" identifier for images).
In this project, I have learned how to read through a source code, act on the projessional curdesy to clean up code, and basic
HTML norms and structural values. 

## Installation

To install, use git clone <repo address> to download onto local storage. Edits can be done directly on github, where you can open the files, or through 
Virtual Studio. 

## Usage

Usage is limited. The purpose of this repo is to fix up code, so users are welcome to inspect the index.html code and css styling sheet. The deployed webpage should look like the following screenshot:
